# "HI EVERYONE"

This Is My First Project On Solidity
Hope You All Will Enjoy It...............

## First We Will Know Little About Solidity What Is Solidity ??
## Any Idea...

No, So Let Me Tell About It To You !!
Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.

### A Small Example as A Code 
 Solidity program to
 demonstrate state
 variables
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;
Creating a contract
contract Solidity_var_Test {
	Declaring a state variable
        uint8 public state_var;	
	Defining a constructor
 constructor() public {
	state_var = 16;
 }
 }
